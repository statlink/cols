Description: Constrained ordinary least squares is performed. One constraint is that all beta coefficients (including the constant) cannot be negative. They can be either 0 or strictly positive. Another constraint is that the sum of the beta coefficients equals a constant. References: Hansen, B. E. (2022). Econometrics, Princeton University Press. <ISBN:9780691235899>.
